## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)
- Git

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ytsync.git
   cd ytsync
   ```

2. **Create Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install black isort pylint bandit  # Development tools
   ```

4. **Copy Example Configuration**
   ```bash
   cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
   # Edit config.yaml with your settings
   ```

## Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **Pylint** for code linting
- **Bandit** for security checks

### Running Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Format code
black main.py
isort main.py

# Check formatting
black --check main.py
isort --check-only main.py

# Lint code
pylint main.py

# Security scan
bandit -r main.py
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Write clear, concise commit messages
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add tests if applicable
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test Your Changes**
   ```bash
   # Run the service locally
   python main.py
   
   # Test with Docker
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **Run Quality Checks**
   ```bash
   black --check main.py
   isort --check-only main.py
   pylint main.py
   ```

5. **Commit and Push**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "type: brief description of changes"
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

6. **Create Pull Request**
   - Use our [PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md)
   - Link related issues
   - Provide clear description of changes

## Commit Message Convention

```
type: brief description

Longer description if needed

- Bullet points for details
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
